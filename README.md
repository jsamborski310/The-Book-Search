## Description

This Google Books API search engine was built with a RESTful API and refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This application was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. 

When a reader visits the site, they are able to search for books within the Google Books API. Readers are able to create an account and login. When logged in, a reader may search for a book and save their favorite books. The See Your Books page displays all saved books. Logged in readers also have access to delete books from this page. 

This application is perfect for avid readers that want to search for new books to read and keep a list of books to purchase.

The UI is clean, polished, and will help the User navigate the site with ease.
